Claude Code usage isn’t free, and keeping costs under control matters—for several reasons:
- Financial awareness: You stay within your budget and avoid unpleasant surprises.
- Environmental responsibility: Less compute = less energy, water, and waste.

I care about both. So, to stay mindful of my Claude Code spend, I built a small macOS app that puts the current usage right in the menu bar:

![claude-nein](/img/claude-nein.png){: .post-image }

It’s called [Claude Nein](https://github.com/forketyfork/claude-nein) — a pun on “cloud nine.”

Since I’m not eager to hand Apple $99/year just to ship an open-source menu bar app, it’s published unsigned. That means you’ll need to jump through some Gatekeeper hoops to run it. Still, it builds cleanly from source, and I’d love feedback, bug reports, or contributions.
