Ollama has released [an app for macOS and Windows](https://ollama.com/blog/new-app) today. I compared it to [Enchanted LLM](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/enchanted-llm/id6474268307) that I typically use. Here's where Ollama shines:
- has a Windows app
- can download models
- has a context window slider

And this is where it falls short compared to Enchanted LLM:
- doesn't have the possibility to copy chat contents
- doesn't have system text-to-speech/speech-to-text integration
- doesn't provide system hotkey integration (e.g. to use local models for autocompletion).

I'll probably keep both apps for now, also since Enchanted LLM hasn't been updated for a year now.
