Tried out the new Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview, was surprised how fast it is. Used it to generate a new icon for the [ClaudeNein](https://github.com/forketyfork/claude-nein) app which turned out to be exactly what I wanted. Couldn't help it, just had to use the "Guardians of the Galaxy" color palette.
