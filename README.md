# Retro Dev Blog

My personal blog with an 80s retro aesthetic, built for GitHub Pages using Jekyll.

## Quick Start

1. Setup development environment:
   ```shell
   cachix use forketyfork
   nix develop
   ```

2. Install pre-commit hooks:
   ```shell
   pre-commit install
   ```

3. Run locally:
   ```shell
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

## Features

- 80s-inspired design with CRT screen effect
- Retro color scheme with classic green terminal text
- Responsive layout
- Scanline animation effect
- Glowing text effects
- Markdown support for blog posts

## Writing Posts

1. Create a new markdown file in the `_posts` directory
2. Name it using the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
3. Add the following front matter at the top of your post:
   ```yaml
   ---
   layout: post
   title: "Your Post Title"
   date: YYYY-MM-DD
   tags: [Tag1, Tag2, Tag3]
   ---
   ```
4. Write your post content in Markdown below the front matter
5. Commit and push to GitHub - your post will be automatically built and published!

## Customization

- Edit `_config.yml` to modify site settings
- Adjust colors and effects in `styles.css`
- Modify layouts in the `_layouts` directory

## Development

This project uses Nix for reproducible development environments and manages Jekyll dependencies through bundler.

### Dependencies
- Ruby 3.4.2 with Jekyll 4.4.1
- Nix flake manages the complete development environment
- Pre-commit hooks automatically update `gemset.nix` when `Gemfile` changes

### Important Notes
- After changing `Gemfile`, both `Gemfile.lock` and `gemset.nix` are automatically regenerated by the pre-commit hook
- The Nix flake ensures `gemset.nix` stays in sync with `Gemfile.lock`
- Use `bundix --lock` to manually regenerate both files if needed
