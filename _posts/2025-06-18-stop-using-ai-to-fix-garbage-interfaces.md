## Intro

Honestly, this whole trend of building AI assistants that can book tickets for you feels like putting lipstick on a pig. Ordering tickets, food, rides — we’re just layering AI on top of a mess we ourselves have helped create. The problem isn’t “I don’t wanna click,” it’s that the clicking is an absolute disaster.

## The Real Problem: Shitty UX Everywhere

Booking a concert ticket shouldn’t be a three-hour slog, but between forced logins, cluttered pages, spam pop‑ups, cookie walls, CAPTCHAs, email verifications, "this site wants to show you notifications" pop-ups that any sane person would only accept by mistake… of course people yearn for an AI sidekick. The underlying issue: every service we made has terrible UI. Fix the root cause, and there’s no need for an AI.

This AI wave is just symptomatic. We've implemented  processes, then built bots to work around them.

## AI Doesn’t Fix UX, It Masks It

When you think, “Just let AI handle booking my flight or ordering dinner,” consider this:
- AI replicates the same messy workflow.
- It introduces new failure modes: accent mismatches, misunderstandings, flubbed forms.
- And you still need to babysit it through logins, 2FA, or spam walls.

You’re better off cleaning up the process than delegating the mess.

## The Real Fix: One Clean Interface for Everything

Imagine a single provider that handles concerts, flights, food, rides—through one simple, unified form:
- Name, payment, task.
- Done.
- No 15 different websites.
- No spam, no verification gymnastics.
- No AI babysitter telling you “sorry I didn’t understand.”

Build it right—no AI required.

## Digital Communism or Just Sanity?

Yeah, it sounds dystopian: one interface for booking everything. But isn’t that what we actually want? Predictable, reliable, fast. But instead we're exposed to fifteen half-assed systems and now need AI to band-aid them.

## Voice AI Is Just a Stopgap

Voice assistants are getting better, but at the end of the day:
- They exist because the old methods are painful.
- They’re glitchy and still need fallback staff.
- They reflect technical imbalance—not a long-term solution.

## Conclusion: Fix UX, Forget AI Band-aids

Until we build real interfaces, we’ll keep inventing AI to cover up our own crap. So maybe it’s time to ask: should we work harder on building good forms instead of launching another AI assistant?
