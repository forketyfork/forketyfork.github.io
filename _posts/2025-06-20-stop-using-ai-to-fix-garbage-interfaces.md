title: "Stop Using AI to Fix Garbage Interfaces - Build Better Ones"

We're slapping AI assistants on broken systems and calling it innovation. Booking tickets, ordering food, hailing rides — all the places where AI is supposed to "help" are just UX graveyards we've created. You don't hand over booking a flight to an AI because it's beneath you — you do it because it's a multi-hour nightmare.

Now imagine booking a ticket was actually fast and pleasant. Imagine the person building that system cared about making it fast and pleasant. But no. "Make this seamless and effortless" — said no product manager ever. Instead, it's all about "engagement," making sure users spend more time on our bloated, ad-infested site. You log in, get subscribed to newsletters you never asked for, and get pushed through a dark pattern funnel just to give someone your money.

## The Real Problem: Terrible UX Is Everywhere

Booking a concert ticket shouldn't take three hours. But it does. Why? Because of:
* Forced logins
* Cluttered interfaces
* Pop-up spam
* Cookie consent walls
* CAPTCHAs
* Email verification loops
* Push notification nags no sane person wants

Of course people want an AI to deal with this mess. But let's be honest — the real problem is we've normalized awful UI everywhere. And instead of fixing it, we're now duct-taping bots over the top.

## The Real Fix: One Clean Interface That Just Works

Picture this: a single global platform for booking concert tickets (flights, rides, etc.) The UI? One clean form:
* Name
* Location
* Seat preference
* Payment
* Done

No 15 tabs open. No forced account creation (seriously, give me one good reason I need to "register" to buy something — I'll wait). No spam. No verification circus.

If you build it right, there's no need for AI. Just good UX.

## Digital Communism or Just Basic Sanity?

Sure, having one interface for everything sounds dystopian. But maybe it's just... rational? We crave tools that are predictable, fast, and usable. Instead, we get a dozen half-baked services and then bring in AI as a bandaid.

Until we actually build good interfaces, we'll keep wasting time developing AI that papers over our own failures. So let's stop asking how AI can make things easier — and start asking why things are so hard in the first place.
